With the purpose of facilitating browsing the large amount of NDC offers provided by airlines on certain routes we have implemented a way o visualising all grouped by equal itineraries showing different cabin and fare combinations as options.

The agent can activate this option by checking the Group Itineraries check when shopping NDC results.

Once activated NDC offers will appear like this.

This feature facilitates the visualisation of the entire cabins/fares catalogue at one sight, and the possibility of offering good upgrade deals to the customer, which well-known to be one of the main objetives of NDC as a new distribution strategy itself.
