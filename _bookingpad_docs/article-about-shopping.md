### The Legend

Icarus's father [Daedalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus "Daedalus"), a very talented and remarkable [Athenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens") craftsman, built the [Labyrinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_Labyrinth "Cretan Labyrinth") for [King Minos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos "Minos") of Crete near his palace at [Knossos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knossos "Knossos") to imprison the [Minotaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur "Minotaur"), a half-man, half-bull monster born of his wife and the [Cretan bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_bull "Cretan bull"). Minos imprisoned Daedalus himself in the labyrinth because he gave Minos's daughter, [Ariadne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne "Ariadne"), a [clew](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clew "wikt:clew")\[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus#cite_note-2) (or ball of string) in order to help [Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus "Theseus"), the enemy of Minos, to survive the Labyrinth and defeat the Minotaur.
