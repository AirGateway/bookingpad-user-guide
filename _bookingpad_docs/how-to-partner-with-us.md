### Classical literature

Icarus' flight was often alluded to by Greek poets in passing, but the story was told briefly in [Pseudo-Apollodorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Apollodorus "Pseudo-Apollodorus").[\[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus#cite_note-8) In the [literature of ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_literature "Latin literature"), the myth was of interest to [Augustan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustan_literature_(ancient_Rome) "Augustan literature (ancient Rome)") writers. [Hyginus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyginus "Hyginus") narrates it in *[Fabula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabulae "Fabulae")* 40, beginning with the bovine love affair of [Pasiphaë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasipha%C3%AB "Pasiphaë"), daughter of the Sun, resulting in the birth of the [Minotaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur "Minotaur"). [Ovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid "Ovid") narrates the story of Icarus at some length in the *[Metamorphoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses_(poem) "Metamorphoses (poem)")* (viii.183–235), and refers to it elsewhere.[\[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus#cite_note-9)
