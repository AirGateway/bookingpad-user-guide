# Icarus

In [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology"), **Icarus** ([/ˈɪkərəs/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): Ἴκαρος [\[ǐːkaros]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Greek "Help:IPA/Greek")) is the son of the [master craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_craftsman "Master craftsman") [Daedalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus "Daedalus"), the creator of the [Labyrinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth "Labyrinth"). Icarus and his father attempt to escape from [Crete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete "Crete") by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of [hubris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris "Hubris"), asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings nor the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun; when the wax in his wings melted he tumbled out of the sky and fell into the sea where he drowned, sparking the idiom *"don't fly too close to the sun"*.
