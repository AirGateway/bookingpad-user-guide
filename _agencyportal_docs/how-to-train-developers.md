### Medieval, Renaissance, and Modern literature

In Renaissance [iconography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconography "Iconography"), the significance of Icarus depends on context: in the Orion Fountain at Messina, he is one of many figures associated with water; but he is also shown on the Bankruptcy Court of the Amsterdam Town Hall – where he [symbolizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol "Symbol") high-flying ambition.[\[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus#cite_note-16) The 16th-century painting *[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_with_the_Fall_of_Icarus "Landscape with the Fall of Icarus")*, traditionally but perhaps erroneously attributed to [Pieter Bruegel the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder "Pieter Bruegel the Elder"), was the inspiration for two of the 20th century's most notable [ecphrastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecphrasis "Ecphrasis") English-language poems, "[Musée des Beaux Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_des_Beaux_Arts_(poem) "Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)")" by [W. H. Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden "W. H. Auden") and "[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_with_the_Fall_of_Icarus_(poem) "Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (poem)")" by [William Carlos Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Carlos_Williams "William Carlos Williams"). Other English-language poems referencing the Icarus myth are "To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Triumph" by [Anne Sexton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Sexton "Anne Sexton"), "Icarus Again" by Alan Devenish, "Mrs Icarus" by [Carol Ann Duffy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Ann_Duffy "Carol Ann Duffy"), "Failing and Flying" by [Jack Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Gilbert "Jack Gilbert"), and "Icarus Burning" and "Icarus Redux" in Hiromi Yoshida's *Icarus Burning* chapbook (Finishing Line Press, 2020). The Norwegian [Axel Jensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Jensen "Axel Jensen") used Icarus as a metaphor for troubled modern young men, in the 1957 novel *Icarus: A Young Man in Sahara*.
